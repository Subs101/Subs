How to get program running:

type in "make all"
	
4 programs will compile...

1. changedp

  	type "changedp  Coin1.txt" to run this program.	
	generates a file name "Coin1change.txt" with
	solutions to coin1.txt inside.
   

2. changegreedy

	type "changegreedy  Coin1.txt" to run this program.	
	generates a file name "Coin1change.txt" with
	solutions to coin1.txt inside.

3. changeslow

	
	type "changeslow  Coin2.txt" to run this program.	
	generates a file name "Coin2change.txt" with
	solutions to coin2.txt inside. 
	*Do not run this with coin1.txt because it is very 
	slow with change values > 20"

4. timeanalysis

	type "timeanalysis" to run this program. Generates
	textfiles with time and change data inside that I used
	to create plots on excel.

has, the visual and the value. The visual is what is displayed
on the screen and looks like a standard playing card. The value
of the card is what is used in logical comparisons to determine 
the strength of the poker hand.

money when the round is over.

It also holds functions to see if a player has won the round and game
since winning has the same conditions for both poker types.
